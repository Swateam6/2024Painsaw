1.Setup power for a esc, get it working and firmware checked out. 
2. Test motors using esc
3. Figure out how to connect the esc to the radio reciever and get one motor working remotely
4. Setup can bus between motor? I don't know how to do this wirelessly. Also can does very poorly when damaged. 
5. Look into sending from one controller to multiple recievers.
